### Projects
* Game "Engines"
  * [quartz](./C++/quartz/) - My first attempt at a game engine, worked on in fall of 2020.
  * [manta](./C++/manta/README.md) - A project started in the summer of 2021 to create an OpenGL4 game engine
  * [manta-rust](./Rust/Manta-Rust) - An attempt to recreate the manta engine in Rust (it was a failure, but a great learning experience)
  * [sapphire](./C++/sapphire/README.md) - My latest attempt at a game engine, started at the beginning of 2023, had both OpenGL and Vulkan rendering backends
  * [val](./C++/val/README.md) - The abstraction layer behind sapphire's Vulkan rendering backend
* Shaders
  * [OpalCollection](./ShaderLab/OpalCollection/README.md) - A collection of built in render pipeline shaders that both extend upon the standard shader (BRDF) and have unique styles (Toon)
* MonoGame
  * [MG-MSDF](./C#/MG-MSDF/README.md) - An [MSDF](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen) text renderer for monogame, built for a private project
* Unity
  * [GPURT](./Unity/GPURT/) - A GPU Raytracer made for Unity, supports movable and static objects. Uses a lot of bruteforcing!
* Discord Bots
  * [oai-bot](./Python/oai-bot/README.md) - A discord bot made to use pre-ChatGPT models to act as a chat bot (as you may have guessed, it's not very good, but fun to mess with)
  * [diffusion-bot](./Python/diffusion-bot/README.md) - A discord bot that uses the REST API of a local [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) instance to generate images
* Misc
  * [mandlebrot-webgl](./JS/mandlebrot-webgl/README.md) - A mandlebrot set renderer with both a CPU and GPU component that runs in your browser!
  * [assetmigrator-rs](./Rust/AssetMigrator-rs/README.md) - A rewrite of [PrefabConverter](https://github.com/notnotnotswipez/PrefabConverter) in Rust for parallel conversions
  * [rsnumerics](./Rust/rsnumerics/README.md) - A flawed attempt at recreating a math library for Rust (basically a port of GLM)
